# Non-Photorealistic
**Project Title: Non-Photorealistic Rendering Using Computer Vision**

**Overview:**
The "Non-Photorealistic Rendering Using Computer Vision" project explores innovative techniques in computer vision to create non-photorealistic renditions of images. Leveraging features extracted from a dataset of images, the project utilizes specialized computer vision models such as cv2.edgePreservingFilter(), cv2.DetailEnhance(), cv2.pencilSketch(), and cv2.stylization(). The aim is to transform images into artistic, non-photorealistic representations that mimic various traditional art styles.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Compiled a diverse dataset of images representing various scenes, objects, and subjects.
   - Ensured the inclusion of images with different characteristics to showcase the versatility of non-photorealistic rendering.

2. **Non-Photorealistic Rendering Models:**
   - Utilized specialized computer vision models provided by the OpenCV library for non-photorealistic rendering:
      - `cv2.edgePreservingFilter()`: Preserves edges in an image, giving it a stylized and abstract appearance.
      - `cv2.DetailEnhance()`: Enhances fine details in an image, emphasizing textures and creating a unique visual effect.
      - `cv2.pencilSketch()`: Simulates a pencil sketch effect on an image, introducing lines and shades reminiscent of hand-drawn sketches.
      - `cv2.stylization()`: Applies a stylization filter to an image, producing artistic and painterly effects.

3. **Image Transformation:**
   - Applied the non-photorealistic rendering models to transform the input images into artistic representations.
   - Experimented with different combinations of models and parameters to achieve diverse rendering styles.

4. **Visualization and Comparison:**
   - Generated visualizations showcasing the original images and their corresponding non-photorealistic renderings.
   - Conducted a comparative analysis to highlight the distinct characteristics and artistic nuances introduced by each rendering model.

5. **Artistic Exploration:**
   - Encouraged artistic exploration by providing a platform for users to experiment with the rendering models and customize parameters.
   - Fostered creativity and engagement by allowing users to interactively apply different rendering styles to their own images.

**Conclusion:**
The "Non-Photorealistic Rendering Using Computer Vision" project demonstrates the potential of computer vision in transforming ordinary images into captivating and artistic representations. By employing specialized rendering models, the project opens avenues for creative expression and exploration in the field of image processing. The project contributes to the broader understanding of non-photorealistic rendering techniques and their applications in art, design, and visual communication. The user-friendly interface invites individuals to explore the intersection of technology and creativity, fostering an appreciation for the diverse possibilities offered by computer vision.
